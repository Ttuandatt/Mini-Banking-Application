### 🔹 Graph Algorithms

| Algorithm | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **BFS** | Shortest path (unweighted), Level order |
| **DFS** | Connectivity, Cycle detection, Topological |
| **Dijkstra** | Shortest path (weighted, no negative) |
| **Bellman-Ford** | Shortest path (with negative edges) |
| **Floyd-Warshall** | All-pairs shortest path |
| **Union-Find** | Connected components, Kruskal's MST |
| **Topological Sort** | Task scheduling, Course prerequisites |

✅ **Checkpoint:** Can you recognize which technique to apply within 2 minutes of reading a problem?

## Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Week 11-12)
*For FAANG-level preparation.*

- **Tries** — Autocomplete, Word Search II
- **Segment Trees** — Range queries
- **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick)** — Prefix sums with updates
- **Advanced Graph** — Tarjan's SCC, Articulation Points
- **Bit Manipulation** — XOR tricks, Subset enumeration

---

## Phase 5: Interview Grinding (Ongoing)
*Where knowledge becomes muscle memory.*

### 📌 Platform Strategy

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **LeetCode** | Primary grinding (aim for 200-300 problems) |
| **NeetCode 150** | Curated patterns, video explanations |
| **HackerRank** | Company-specific practice |
| **Codeforces** | Competitive edge (optional) |

### 📌 Daily Practice Routine
Mon-Fri: 2-3 problems/day (1 Easy, 1-2 Medium)
Weekend: 1 Hard problem + Review weak areas


### 📌 The 20-Minute Rule
- Spend max 20 min on a problem before looking at hints
- After solving, always study 2-3 other solutions
- Write down the **pattern**, not just the answer

### 📌 Pattern Recognition (The Real Skill)

| If you see... | Think... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Subarray" / "Substring" | Sliding Window / Two Pointers |
| "Top K" / "Kth largest" | Heap |
| "Shortest path" | BFS / Dijkstra |
| "All possibilities" | Backtracking / DFS |
| "Optimal substructure" | DP |
| "Connected / Groups" | Union-Find / DFS |
| "Sorted + Search" | Binary Search |
